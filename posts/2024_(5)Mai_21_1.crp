" So, you wondering, why did I make a blackout starting from 21.05.2024 17:00 UTC? "
" It's because of policy of Continental #3. They have problems with hosting this webpage in the continents due to their rapid growth of their infrastructure. "
" Yeah, it's wild, and so actually, I haven't passed prÃ¼fung, but gonna ask for retry. That blackout would last 24 hrs at minimum. If it's not, well, I have more serious failure. "
" Bis Bald! "
