    <h1>YAY, I HAVE MY OWN BIRTHDAY</h1>
    <div>I've got 18th year, and now, I have full version of rights.</div>
    <div>In this day, I wasn't doomed by calls, maybe because I'm in another country</div>
    <div>So, I drew this and embeded in the picture a music, what I can associate myself</div>
