T=>Review: one Twitter account-composer<=T
Well, It seems like I have way stronger opinions about anything I got into. I saw that one composer, which makes music with vocal, and in my recommendations I saw people’s Spotify wrapped and I saw their tracks. So I wondered, is this composer cooler than I listened to another dude from Twitter. Started to listen to the most recent track and bruh… The beginning is banging, but, as said, hope dies at last. The track starts with a vocal section, and chorus and starts to ask myself, am I in the anime intro or what?? Vocal sounds like Japanese, but sung in English, and it's a bit odd for me. I am not into the composer. That dude is like from 2012, but I’m guessing it was just an inactive account until 2020. WHY TF YOU GOT INTO THE COMPOSER??? I listened to 2 MORE tracks and it’s still pissing me off. HAU? It’s like Taylor Swift - she’s cool but music isn’t.
