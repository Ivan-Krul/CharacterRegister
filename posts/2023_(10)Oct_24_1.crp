" It's an another drawing from my old assets! This time, another newer asset but still old af (dated in 7 Nov 2021).
    Why did I call this image "Recreation of whoever was he"? That's because it could be a main character, or should I say - 1 of 12 main characters.
    That's insane, really, but then I thought, I could handle that, but over the time, it's became difficult to do a plot branching, so
    I decreased amount of main characters down to 3(Trio). So put it away for so long, what I put out my idea, and so, I forgot what they was named.
    In my computer should be a file, what contains all their info, just need to search... <br/>
    Man... I drew this dude like Tom 7! "
