    Now I have a new computer, but I haven't synced my data yet. I would work on.
    Also this computer contains Window 11, so I can look at this system.
    I thought, I would not get used to Windows 11, but it's not!
    But I have to leave my place and move temporary to Vienna.
    That would be sad for me :(, because I wouldn't get used to rapidly changing enviroument, so wish me luck.
