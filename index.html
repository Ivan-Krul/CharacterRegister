        <div>
            It's an another drawing from my old assets! This time, another newer asset but still old af (dated in 7 Nov 2021).
            Why did I call this image "Recreation of whoever was he"? That's because it could be a main character, or should I say - 1 of 12 main characters.
            That's insane, really, but then I thought, I could handle that, but over the time, it's became difficult to do a plot branching, so
            I decreased amount of main characters down to 3(Trio). So put it away for so long, what I put out my idea, and so, I forgot what they was named.
            In my computer should be a file, what contains all their info, just need to search...

        <div>
            It's a redrawing of my old assets of tree from the 28th of June 2022! That's really old and found this asset accidently.
            So, I decided to draw and I did it! It brings me to my old, more young ages(2 years), when I was insprired by DELTARUNE, OMORI and OneShot.
            Yes, it's a part of Wanichusilk(my dream project). And it's visible how I grew up...

        <img src="./image/Ostafan/order to ADA.png">
        <div>Order to ADA. I mean, to air defense. Yes, here is Ostafan was hired as a soldier of air defense in SN. Also Kevin was, but Ostafan accidently shot to him.
            Kevin prepared to Haloween cycle after a 5TH! mind war. He forgot, what in mind, haloween has been banning for a year. Ostafan didn't know that.
            Kevin would survive, but a witch what flied with him was disappeared after a shot.
            Why is this a forest?

            But the main difference is aftermath of 5th mind war. Jania is still alone siting on pumpkin and missing for Kiwuar.
