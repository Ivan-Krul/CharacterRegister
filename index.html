                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This is a register, what I made for myself. Here you can watch all my characters and/or other
                    things what have relation with these characters.</p>
                <p>
                    You can spectate my world called <span style="font-size: larger;">ùìúùì≤ùì∑ùì≠</span>. It's an illusion,
                    it's a vendor, it's a valve, and
                    last but not least, it's a matrix.
                    Can they exist without that? No. They dependant, but from who? I don't want to tell you...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, It have an older version of that called OCDataBase. It still haven't design yet, but
                    it's a better that in older version.
                    It would use future technologies called JavaScript and one-page loading resources!
                    They're better that in older version because I can rest after designing separate pages and
                    then manage them.
                    It would takes a profile, story and image files, and insert them in marked sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like design hub for me. I can just precreate all thigs here and if I want, link it.
                    These stories are relatable or not yet. The application holds not only from Github-Pages, it
                    also hosts in Fur and even Ima!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is the Ima, Fur, or others definition? It's a whole countries!! In Mind, no one cares
                    what is would be: "Anime", "<a href="./pages/def.html?def=ESC">ESC</a>", "SN", "Life" or even
                    "Skills".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then what is the "Mind"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last, I would write more characters and not only mine!
                    Even bad experience is also experience!
