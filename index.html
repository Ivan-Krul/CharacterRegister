        <div>Order to ADA. I mean, to air defense. Yes, here is Ostafan was hired as a soldier of air defense in SN. Also Kevin was, but Ostafan accidently shot to him.
            Kevin prepared to Haloween cycle after a 5TH! mind war. He forgot, what in mind, haloween has been banning for a year. Ostafan didn't know that.
            Kevin would survive, but a witch what flied with him was disappeared after a shot.
            Why is this a forest?
