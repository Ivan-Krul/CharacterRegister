        <h2>About Character Register</h2>
        <div>This is a register, what I made for myself. Here you can watch all my characters and/or other things what have relation with these characters.</div>
        <div>
            You can spectate my world called Mind. It's an illusion, it's a vendor, it's a valve, and last but not least, it's a matrix.
            Can they exist without that? No. They dependant, but from who? I don't want to tell you...
        </div>
        <div>
            Anyway, It have an older version of that called OCDataBase. It still haven't design yet, but it's a better that in older version.
            It would use future technologies called JavaScript and one-page loading resources!
            They're better that in older version because I can rest after designing separate pages and then manage them.
            It would takes a profile, story and image files, and insert them in marked sequence.
        </div>
        <div>
            At last, I would write more characters and not only mine(and not only furry). I think, this webpage wouldn't die, I hope...
