  "_": "It's a satira on whole artist cluster, specially someone, who draws, but not got into story section. He's popular as heel, but even a good composion isn't enough for creating base for stories. I know, even when it's kinda exists settings, like whole ass planetary system with different envirouments. He's world is missing fundamental detail - problem. The world's problem isn't exist, like it's utopia. It's not real, so SHUT UP saying and making whole ass articles, what makes no sense, if it's feels not real enough. It has to be any problem, like uhhh... a threat from different planet system, where is preparing to conquest. \"What conquest? It's actually a peace!!! LGBTQ+ rulz let's goooooooooo!!!!\". Never rate settings or whole world by looking. Even when my world \"mind\" is looks so much purpley. Even when my world is mostly empty. Let your stories deep you in, and no-exit point was reached. Over and over again... And that's it! Rating these worlds would be so high, my is example. Through my all 3 years of editing the world. I showed to some artists like... Meta, Kitarango, Rai, Annas, Codename Delta, others who was forgotten by me (srry). They was even INSPIRED BY ME to do something huge, complex, you got me. In conclusion, good art, but they have also give something more, than \"Ooo, what a cutie bunny!!(likes and repost)\". They have to give story, tragedy, pain, something meaningfull to feel more realistic. These stories are dived in so well, you would love stories more, than arts about them themselves",
