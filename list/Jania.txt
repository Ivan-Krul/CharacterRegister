Mother of Jania, Kate wanted, what she
 became a trade bureaucracy, because Kate thought,
 what their family will pay off debts.\
Jania loves to make friends. She has above 10 friends.
 Jania joined to hanging sessions 8 times on average
 for a week. But not all her friends trusted her,
 Diana was the riches person in sessions, and every
 single time, Jania tried to get a money from her.
 Diana - "Jania wants my money, I don't know,
 what's methodes she decide to take money
 from me. I was scared, when Jania was
 appeared in clothes shop".\
She loves to travel around the country Anime, because,
 Jania was there, when she had 14 years old. Jania was
 so impressed with it, what decided to travel with her
 friends, but she hasn't enought of money for that.\
Jania loves to be in the center of the attention.
 It because she loves to get attention and be
 accepted. When someone is in the center of the
 attention, then she's trying to be near the
 object of public attention. Some Jania's friends
 says, what "If you see something Intresting, then
 she will appear nearby".\
Jania sometimes can tell her friends about investiments.
 She think, what this should be intresting for her friends,
 especially for Mitchell. Mitchell - "That's why I'm still
 be friend with Jania, she can tell me about the investiment
 world and cheer me to make my first investiment".\
One time, Jania decided to visit Kiwuar,
 with her friends, but, unfortunatly, nobody didn't
 accept to visit him. Jania started to argue with her
 friends. It's because nobody wanted to visit Kiwuar
 "Why we should go to the Kiwuar? He's soo boring.
 Moreover, he suggest us to go to a plain, and that's
 disgusting..." but she didn't listened them. Jania
 - "Are you going to regect him, as my friend, I think no".\
One time, Jania was with friends in another town,
 but it was crowded. She wanted to try an attraction and
 ride with her friends. That's was fun, but one time,
 she saw, what people are coming to one place. A famous
 person is came to the attraction. But was soo much people,
 so, Jania decided to go back to her friends. When she
 started to go to her friends, she couldn't found them.
 Jania was patient, and started to go away from crowd.
 Then, she started to connect to Mitchell and said, what
 she's waited near road. Her friend come here and was
 happy to found their friend.\
One time, Jania heard something very far. She decided,
 what need to get out of there, and go to the furthest place,
 as possible. When she with her parents still preparerad,
 Jania saw Kiwuar, what looks scared. After preperation,
 they started to get out of there. After long time of
 forced travelling, they came to Art.\
She saw a light under herself. Jania was shocked about
 that. Suddently, metal plates was appeared and surrounded
 her. Jania's mom, Kate was scared, and tried to save her
 from being stuck, but it was too strong. Kate cried about
 it, but Jania relieved her. Kate - "I will missing you".
 metalic plates was became a rocket, what will be launched
 soon. Jania heard some sound - "TARGET - ESC REGION.
 CONNECTION DETECTED. STARTING ROCKET PROTOCOL SYSTEM.
 TURNING ON ENGINES. LAUNCH". Jania felt load out of
 surface, and suddently felt a huge load, directed her
 to the bottom of the rocket. Jania had fainted. [next]\
... [next]\
She woke up in the different place, but still in the
 rocket. It's was very scientific: a lot of chambers,
 devices, etc. Jania - "Where am I?". Jania felt brakes.
 The rocket opened up, and someone said - "JANIA. GET OFF
 THE ROCKET AND STAND ON THE PLATE". Jania - "Ok...".
 She decided to stant from the rocket, but not on the
 plate, because Jania wanted to inspect the place.
 Jania saw creatures, what are a lot different between
 her species. Also, she saw a test chamber, what inventing
 new technology. At least, there's not comfort there,
 but that's okay. Someone - "JANIA. STAND ON THE PLATE,
 OR WE WILL DESINTEGRATE YOU". Jania - "Fine". She
 stand on the plate. Jania was started to fly, and... [next]\
"Turning on the initializion process... Done! Need more...". [next] \
She saw someting, but couldn't describe. Later, the
 "process" had done and she was fell down. Jania was
 hurted. Then, someone said - "JANIA. GET IN THE ROCKET".
 Jania - "I don't forget the place...". She sat down in the
 rocket. She again fainted after a huge load. [next]\
... [next]\
Jania woke up, and got, what she is free. She saw,
 what around her rocket fragments, what slowly
 disolving. Jania saw her mom, Kate, what sleep.
 She decided, to wake up Kate. Jania - "Wake up,
 I'm back". Kate - "Oh dear! Thanks mindness, what you're
 back!" Kate started to crying and hugging her.
 [But we know, Jania has been becoming a new fursona
 of Kiwii Devulopir since now]\
After a long time of being in Art, the war ended.
 Jania with her mom, Kate decided to arrive at Fur.
 There were a lot of ruins, especially in the north
 side of the country. There are a few people walking
 outside. Also there's a supply point, where all can
 get aid. They understood, their home survived, so they
 came to the home. Jania accepted and waited for her old
 gang to tell, what she cares about.\
One time, Jania decided to go to the Kiwuar and discover,
 is he there. Jania walked to the Kiwuar's town and
 saw some buildings are still broken. When she came to the
 Kiwuar's house, she saw repairing house, what it
 wasn't Kiwuar's house. She knocked a door and waited
 for a while. Later, the door was opened and it was a
 Kiwuar's mother, Julia. Jania asked about him, but
 Julia answered, what he was disappeared. Jania(shocked)
 - "Really? Do you know when?"\
Julia - "5 cycles after declearing the 4th Mind war. \
``Kiwuar was exhausted, with no energy to create
 anything and he was silent. Sometimes he even cried.
 One time, after 4 cycles, he was so tired, what he asked
 his mom, Julia, to go outside. He later disappeared from
 ruins of the village\
Jania(sadly) - "Oh..." Jania felt the same pain as in Julia, as thought.
 She started crying and hugged Julia. Julia also cried.
 Jania - "I'm feeling the same pain as you" Julia - "I know"
 Jania said goodbye and got, what Kiwuar was disappeared
 forever.\
